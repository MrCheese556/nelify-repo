        <h1>Explanation:</h1>
        <p>
            This is a demonstration of a neural network. You can train your own car to drive, and then try to race against it.
             <span class = "magic">(You will probably lose.)</span> <br><br>
             To start, just hit the refresh button in the center.<br><br>
              Each time you do this, a new generation of cars are spawned, and the amount is specified on the left.<br><br>
               Only choose a high amount <span class = "magic">(Above 500)</span> if your computer can handle it. When you are running a simulation and see a car pull ahead <span class = "magic">(Wait a few seconds first)</span>, click the save button. <br><br>
               The algorithm works similar to evolution, where each new generation of cars has the same brain as the saved one <span class = "magic">(The best model)</span>, but with a little mutation. <br><br>
               The more times you save, reload, and mutate the cars, the better the entire species will become.<br><br>
               If you ever want to race with your cars, click the red car button, which will spawn a drivable <span class = "magic">(Arrow keys)</span> car.<br><br>
               Good luck (Hover on this message to see the parts of the network)
